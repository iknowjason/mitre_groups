# mitre_groups
MITRE ATT&amp;CK threat actor groups imported as markdown and showing TTPs used.
Some of these scripts and content were inspired by Roberto Rodriguez and his Generative AI Adventures github repository:
https://github.com/OTRF/GenAI-Security-Adventures.  
Scripts from this repository have been changed for latest LangChain library.  
Huge H/T to him.
